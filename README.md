Introduction

Heat treatement of bearing components involves multistage operations, where the parts are taken at inlet section and processed with various treatments. There is a need to monitor the incoming and outgoing parts in the furnace. In case of parts coming out are less than that of inlet few parts are stuck in various section of the multistage process. The missing parts which are stuck at different locations in the multistage operation unit , results in interior quality loss of material.

Objective

- To develop a computer vision system for real time counting of parts at inlet and outlet sections of the multistage heat treatment furnace.
- To use AI-YOLOv8 model for achieving 99.9% accuracy.
- To deliver optimum perfomance in the harsh industry environment.
- To use hardware resources with optimum consideration of cost and reliability.
